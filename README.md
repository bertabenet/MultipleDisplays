This project is the extended version of [RollABall](https://github.com/bertabenet/RollABall) which contains the three required aspects for P4:
1. A setup to render the image in a panoramic display (two continuous screens --> Display 1 and Display 2)
2. A mini map camera that shows the game from the top view
3. A render texture in an object in the scene from the view of a second camera (the second camera follows the player's ball and it is displayed in a cube that resembles a screen)
